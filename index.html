                    <h2>Flood warning in Delhi as rains batter north India</h2>

                <div class = "articlecontent">
                    <P>India's weather office has warned of more heavy rains
                        Heavy rains are continuing to cause havoc across northern India, claiming at least 20 lives since Saturday.                        
                        The bad weather - which is expected to continue into Friday - has downed trees, flooded homes and closed major roads in several states.                        
                        On Tuesday, Delhi was put on high alert for flooding as water levels in the Yamuna river rose to dangerous levels.                       
                        Officials have since relocated thousands of people living near the river banks to safer locations.                        
                        Residents living in other vulnerable areas have also been told to prepare to be evacuated if needed.                        
                        Traffic over a key bridge, which runs over the river, was cut off and schools are closed for a second day due to heavy rainfall.                        
                        Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the next two days would be crucial for the city, but added that his government was prepared to tackle any situation.
                        India's weather department has warned that heavy rains are expected to continue in the region well into the weekend.
                        In the Himalayan states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, teams of the Indian army and the National Disaster Response Force have been carrying out rescue operations after landslides and flash floods damaged roads and buildings.
                        In Himachal Pradesh, over 700 roads and key highways have been closed due to landslides.
                        Massive waterlogging was also reported in the states of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana.

                <div class = "articlecontent">
                    Tata Group, India's largest conglomerate, is close to an agreement to acquire an Apple Inc. supplier's factory as soon as August, marking the first time a local company would move into the assembly of iPhones, according to people familiar with the matter.<br>
                    A takeover of the Wistron Corp. factory in Karnataka, potentially valued at more than $600 million, would cap about a year of negotiations, said the people, asking not to be named as the matter is private. The facility employs more than 10,000 workers, who assemble the latest iPhone 14 model.    <br>
                    Wistron has committed to ship iPhones worth at least $1.8 billion from the factory in the fiscal year through March 2024 to win state-backed financial incentives, the people said. It also planned to triple the plant's workforce by next year. Tata is set to honor those commitments as Wistron exits the iPhone business in India.

                    <p>A 10-year-old girl in Australia has been diagnosed with a rare and debilitating condition, which causes her excruciating pain in her entire right leg when she moves or even when someone touches it. <br>
                        According to New York Post, Bella Macey's condition was triggered on a family holiday in Fiji when a blister on her right foot got infected. She was later diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), which is often called the "most painful condition" known to mankind. <br>                       
                       "Since her diagnosis, she has been battling excruciating pain that affects her daily activities and steals away her childhood. Bella's pain has meant she has lost mobility in her right foot and leg, right up to her groin. She is now bedridden or in a wheelchair if she needs to get around," her GoFundMe campaign page read.

                    <p>Mattel's "Barbie" is a live-action PG-13 flick headlined by Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken. It was directed by Greta Gerwig and reportedly had a budget of up to $100 million to make.
                        The movie is slated to hit theaters on July 21, and Robbie, Gosling, and the rest of the star-studded cast are currently out doing red carpet events to build anticipation.                        
                        "Barbie is a cultural conversation at this point," Mattel COO Richard Dickson told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). Dickson is credited with reinventing Barbie and making the brand more in line with cultural trends in his work at Mattel over the last five years.                        
                        Mattel is betting that the cultural conversation around Barbie materializes in strong profit figures, created in a few different ways.
